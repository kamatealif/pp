Challenge: CLI Contact Book (CSV-Powered)

Create a terminal-based contact book tool that stores and manages contacts using a CSV file.

Your program should:

1. Ask the user to choose one of the following options:
   - Add a new contact
   - View all contacts
   - Search for a contact by name
   - Exit
2. Store contacts in a file called `contacts.csv` with columns:
   - Name
   - Phone
   - Email
3. If the file doesn't exist, create it automatically.
4. Keep the interface clean and clear.

Example:
Add Contact
View All Contacts
Search Contact
Exit

Bonus:

- Format the contact list in a table-like view
- Allow partial match search
- Prevent duplicate names from being added
