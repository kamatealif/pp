Challenge: Offline Credential Manager

Create a CLI tool to manage login credentials (website, username, password) in an encoded local file (`vault.txt`).

Your program should:
1. Add new credentials (website, username, password)
2. Automatically rate password strength (weak/medium/strong)
3. Encode the saved content using Base64 for simple offline obfuscation
4. View all saved credentials (decoding them)
5. Update password for any existing website entry (assignment)

Bonus:
- Support searching for a website entry
- Mask password when showing in the list
